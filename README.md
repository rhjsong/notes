The goal of the repository is to compile a list of notes on topics that I find interesting.

This was largely inspired by the following reasons.
* Want to learn more about topics which I'm interested in
  * Distributed systems
  * Machine learning
  * Biological algorithms
* Want to get better at writing
  * Paul Graham
  * Prof. Morris / Kaashoek
* Want to learn more about myself
